# Machine Learning Models:

During the experimentation phase, I trained several ML models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Ensemble Learning, and AdaBoost. These models were used to make predictions on the test set and identify individuals who may be at risk of suicide.

# Deep Learning Models:

In addition to the ML models, I also experimented with several DL models such as LSTM, GRU, CNN, and BERT. To improve the performance of the BERT model, I fine-tuned it using the ktrain library. By fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model, I was able to capture the context and nuances of the text better, resulting in higher accuracy and F1 scores. These DL models were used alongside the ML models to identify individuals who may be at risk of suicide.
